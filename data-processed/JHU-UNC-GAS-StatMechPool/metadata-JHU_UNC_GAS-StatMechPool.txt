  methods:  This model trains jointly over all states and counties in the US, with a loss that contains both a simple mechanistic model 
   as well as a statistical model. The statistical model  enforces the constraint that places with similar properties have  similar mechanistic 
   coefficients. The model uses a detailed list of demographic parameters for US Counties, with demographic parameters taken 
   from https://github.com/Yu-Group/covid19-severity-prediction/ and other variables (weather, mobility, etc) 
   taken from the Opencovid Data Repo. For international sites all properties come from the Opencovid data repo. 
   Finally, the prediction rollouts from the model are generated from the mechanistic model, where the allowed range 
   of mechanistic parameters is fit on historical data for coverage.

  methods_long: To arrive at the best model, we experimented with a large range of mechanistic and statistical models and 
   competed these models against each other. For mechanistic models, we tried: SEIR models and curve fitting models. For the 
   statistical model, we tried:linear model and  a simple multilayer perceptron. We experimented with statistical models 
   enforcing constraints among different numbers of the mechanistic parameters. We also tried models with priors and without. 
   We also varied how much of the trajectories are fitted with the model (last 4 week, 6 week, and so forth).  
   including all combinatorial choices, we ended up with 450 different models.  We evaluated model performance with split dates 
   trained in the past and chose the best models. The best models ended up being (i) a multiplicative growth model for the
   mechanistic term with a linear statistical model in which the statistical model enforces constraints on all mechanistic parameters.  
   (ii) A curve fitting mode [CITE paper] with a pseudolikelihood prior, together with a linear statistical model on all mechanistic parameters. 
   The predictions here ensemble these two models.
